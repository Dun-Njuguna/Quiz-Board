## Technologies used

The logical part of the application is created out of javascript, which is used to collect user answers and then display their score.

### 1.CSS(Cascading style sheet)
Css is used to style there appearance of website on the web. Thus this project was a good exercise to help me understand how best to style a page. The project also tested my ability to use an external cascading style sheet for the whole project.

### 3.Indentation
This refers to the formatting of HTML and CSS. It is easy to read code that is well formatted and work on it on a later date than it is on one that is not. Thus the project tested my ability to apply this.

### 4.Use of version control
It is important that when collaborating or doing an independent project to be able to track the changes and revert to a previous stable state in case of the local copy being damaged.

To use events to control when the logical part of the application is called.
